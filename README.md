For my coursework task I have decided to undertake a challenge from the 2019 advent of code, more exactly the one from day 10. I think that this challenge checks all the aims of the coursework and it overall requires using a good part of what was covered in the module as well as additional content. In order to run the first part of the challenge (called Cw.hs) loading the file and printing answer outputs the correct results. For the second part of the challenge run the file giving it as input the file called (input.in): 'runghc -Wall Part2.hs < input.in'
